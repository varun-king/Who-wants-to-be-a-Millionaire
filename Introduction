# Who wants to be a Millionaire? (Swift)
  
* The game, which was developed in command line interface using Swift, proved one of the best practices for CLI programming, elevating me to get used-to with CLI workflow.   
* First of all, the user has to enter name and select difficulty level, from either "Easy" or "Hard", to proceed and lifelines were provided on the basis of rules that were optional. 
* There were certain rules that were being followed:  
  1. After entering related information, the user will be populated up with a randomly created question along with four vivd questions.
  2. User can select any option which he/she thinks is the right fit according to question populated; later, system will automatically calculate if the answer selected by user was correct one.
  3. If it was correct, the user will be escalated to further level, and if not, then user will lost the game taking $0.
  4. There were different number of levels in disparate difficulties and reward of amount of each level was decided by taking difficulty level in account.
  5. After completing each level, the user can still continue playing the game or can opt out to leave the game with last amount rewarded.
  6. User was provided with 3 options to choose a lifeline, from "Phone a friend", "50-50" and "Audience Poll", which worked identically to live game.
  7. Once, player completes all the levels and wins the game, the message, congratulating him, would pop up and will be displayed how much amount in total he/she won.
